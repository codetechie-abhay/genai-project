              "'**LangChain Overview**\\n\\nLangChain is an open-source Python library that enables the creation of multi-turn conversational AI systems. It provides a modular architecture for building and integrating various components, such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning models, and knowledge graphs.\\n\\n**Key Components**\\n\\n1. **Agents**: Agents are the core components of LangChain, responsible for interacting with the user and generating responses. Agents can be thought of as \"actors\" that perform specific tasks, such as answering questions, providing information, or performing actions.\\n2. **Actions**: Actions are the building blocks of Agents. They define the specific tasks that an Agent can perform, such as retrieving information from a knowledge graph or generating text based on a prompt.\\n3. **Looms**: Looms are data structures that store and manage the state of an Agent\\'s conversation. They provide a way to persist and retrieve conversation history, allowing Agents to maintain context and recall previous interactions.\\n4. **Chains**: Chains are the top-level components of LangChain, representing the complete conversational flow of an Agent. They consist of a sequence of Actions that are executed in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome.\\n\\n**Technical Architecture**\\n\\nLangChain\\'s technical architecture is built around the following concepts:\\n\\n1. **Modular Design**: LangChain is designed as a collection of interconnected modules, each responsible for a specific task or function. This modular design makes it easy to add or replace components as needed.\\n2. **Message Passing**: LangChain uses a message-passing architecture to enable communication between components. When an Action is executed, it sends a message to the Loom, which updates the conversation state and returns the result to the Agent.\\n3. **Event-Driven Programming**: LangChain\\'s architecture is based on event-driven programming, where Agents and Actions respond to specific events, such as user input or changes to the conversation state.\\n\\n**Example Use Case**\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how LangChain might be used to build a simple conversational AI system:\\n\\n```python\\n# Import the necessary modules\\nfrom langchain import Agent, Chain, Loom\\n\\n# Define an Agent that answers questions about a specific topic\\nclass QuestionAgent(Agent):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.loom = Loom()\\n\\n    def ask_question(self, question):\\n        # Retrieve the answer from a knowledge graph\\n        answer = self.loom.get_answer(question)\\n        return answer\\n\\n# Define a Chain that consists of a single Action\\nclass QuestionChain(Chain):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.agent = QuestionAgent()\\n        self.action = self.agent.ask_question\\n\\n# Create an instance of the Chain\\nchain = QuestionChain()\\n\\n# Execute the Chain and print the result\\nresult = chain.run(\"What is the capital of France?\")\\nprint(result)  # Output: \"Paris\"\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we define a simple Agent that answers questions about a specific topic. We then create a Chain that consists of a single Action, which is executed when the Chain is run. The result of the Action is then printed to the console.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nLangChain provides a powerful and flexible framework for building conversational AI systems. Its modular design, message-passing architecture, and event-driven programming model make it easy to add or replace components as needed. By using LangChain, developers can create sophisticated conversational AI systems that can interact with users in a natural and intuitive way.'"

        "This notebook demonstrates a complete customer support chatbot built using LangGraph's conditional flow state architecture. The system follows a structured workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "__start__ → categorize → analyze_sentiment → conditional_routing → handler_functions → __end__\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture Components:\n",
        "1. **State Management**: Maintains query, category, sentiment, and response\n",
        "2. **Categorization**: Classifies queries into billing, technical, general, or escalate\n",
        "3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes emotional tone (positive, neutral, negative)\n",
